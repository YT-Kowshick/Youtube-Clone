# Youtube-Clone
A simple YouTube Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrated with the YouTube Data API v3. It allows users to search for videos and explore trending content based on categories like Gaming, Music, News, and Entertainment. This project is great for learning how to fetch and display data from an external API.
